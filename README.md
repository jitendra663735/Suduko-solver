# Suduko-solver
This C++ program implements a Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a popular number puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9 such that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (boxes) contains all the digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.
